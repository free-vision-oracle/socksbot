the setup
    two teams of two players in interleaved order

the deal
    the first player is determined by drawing for high card
    the entire deck is dealt to the players
    each player arranges their cards by suit

the bidding
    each player looks at their cards and bids the number of books/tricks they think they'll win

the play
    the first player leads with whatever they want this is jail
    each player plays something in the same suit, a spade if they can't, or anything but it doesn't count
    if there is a trump, the highest one wins. if not, the highest rank in the suit that led wins
    the person that won the book/trick starts the next book/trick
    the hand concludes when everyone has played all of their cards.

the scoring
    each player:
        if the player won more books/tricks than they bid, they are awarded as many points as they bid
        if the player won less books/tricks than they bid, the difference is substracted from their overall score.
    first to 25 points wins
